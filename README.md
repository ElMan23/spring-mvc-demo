# Spring MVC Demo 

A tutorial taken from [this Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/spring-hibernate-tutorial/).

## Run on Tomcat server

You need to install Tomcat on your machine: in a directory, eg. `C:\Program Files\Tomcat` if you're on Windows, you need to locate the `apache-tomcat-*` folder (you'll see the version number); in the last folder, locate the directory `bin`, which contains the executable (`tomcat*.exe` with the version number as the last characters).  

If you are using IntelliJ to run the project, your configuration should look as the one provided in the picture `doc-imgs\Tomcat-configuration-IntelliJ.PNG`.

The `src` folder contains the source code packaged.

The `web` folder contains the resources needed to create the web pages and the dependencies (as `.jar` files in the `lib` folder).
